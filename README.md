## 🧠 Zustand Store Overview

Stored in `useCalendarStore.js`, Zustand manages:

- `monthIndex`, `currentYear` → for calendar navigation
- `savedEvents` → all events (persisted in localStorage)
- `filteredEvents` → events filtered by active labels
- `showEventModal`, `selectedEvent`, `daySelected`
- `labels` → label colors and filters
